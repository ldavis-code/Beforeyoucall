## Idea 1: "Workshop Blueprint" — Industrial Technical Manual Aesthetic

**Design Movement**: Industrial Design / Technical Blueprint / Bauhaus Functionalism

**Core Principles**:
1. Form follows function — every element serves the troubleshooting purpose
2. Honest materials — raw, utilitarian surfaces that evoke a workshop environment
3. Systematic clarity — information architecture mirrors the logical diagnostic process
4. Tool-like precision — the interface itself feels like a well-made tool

**Color Philosophy**: 
- Primary: Deep navy (#1B2838) evoking workshop manuals and technical drawings
- Accent: Safety orange (#E8722A) for warnings, CTAs, and active states — the universal color of caution/action
- Surface: Warm concrete gray (#F0EDE8) for backgrounds, like a workbench surface
- Text: Charcoal (#2D3436) for readability with blueprint-blue (#4A6FA5) for links/interactive elements

**Layout Paradigm**: 
- Left-rail persistent category navigation (like a tool pegboard)
- Main content area uses a "manual page" metaphor with clear numbered steps
- Cards use subtle drop shadows and slight rotation to feel like physical reference cards pinned to a board

**Signature Elements**:
1. Dashed-line connectors between troubleshooting steps (like wiring diagrams)
2. "Tab" system that mimics physical manual dividers with category icons
3. Numbered step indicators with a progress rail showing diagnostic flow

**Interaction Philosophy**: 
- Click-to-reveal progressive disclosure — only show the next step when the current one is addressed
- Binary yes/no decision points that branch the flow like a real diagnostic tree
- Satisfying "check" animations when steps are completed

**Animation**: 
- Steps slide in from the right like turning a manual page
- Decision branches animate with a branching line that draws itself
- Category transitions use a subtle "drawer slide" effect
- Completed steps get a stamped checkmark with a slight bounce

**Typography System**:
- Headlines: "DM Sans" Bold — clean, geometric, tool-like
- Body: "Source Sans 3" Regular — highly legible technical text
- Step numbers: "Space Mono" — monospaced for that technical manual feel
- Labels/Tags: "DM Sans" Medium uppercase with generous letter-spacing

## Idea 2: "Field Guide" — Outdoor Handbook / Scouting Manual Aesthetic

**Design Movement**: Mid-century Field Guide / National Park Poster / WPA Illustration Style

**Core Principles**:
1. Approachable expertise — complex info made friendly and inviting
2. Illustrated warmth — hand-drawn quality that feels personal, not corporate
3. Categorical color-coding — each domain has its own visual identity
4. Layered discovery — information reveals itself as you explore deeper

**Color Philosophy**:
- Base: Warm parchment (#FAF6F0) evoking a well-loved reference book
- Automotive: Rust red (#B44D3E)
- Electrical: Amber yellow (#D4A843)
- Lawn & Garden: Forest green (#3D6B4F)
- Motorcycle: Steel blue (#4B6A8A)
- Engine: Burnt sienna (#8B5E3C)
- Text: Dark walnut (#3A2E2A) for warmth over pure black

**Layout Paradigm**:
- Full-width hero with illustrated banner per category
- "Chapter" navigation with illustrated icons — horizontal scrollable on mobile
- Content uses a two-column "field notes" layout: left for steps, right for diagrams/tips
- Asymmetric grid with generous margins that feel like page gutters

**Signature Elements**:
1. Illustrated category icons in a vintage woodcut/linocut style
2. "Field Notes" sidebar tips with a torn-paper edge effect
3. Color-coded category badges that persist as breadcrumbs during troubleshooting

**Interaction Philosophy**:
- Accordion-based troubleshooting trees that expand like flipping pages
- Hover states reveal "quick tip" tooltips styled as handwritten annotations
- Category selection feels like choosing a chapter from a table of contents

**Animation**:
- Page transitions use a subtle paper-fold effect
- Accordion items expand with a smooth spring animation
- Category icons have a gentle stamp/press animation on hover
- Progress indicators fill like an ink line being drawn

**Typography System**:
- Headlines: "Playfair Display" Bold — editorial, authoritative but warm
- Body: "Lora" Regular — serif for that book/manual reading experience
- Labels: "Josefin Sans" SemiBold — clean contrast against serif body
- Accents: "Caveat" for handwritten-style annotations and tips

## Idea 3: "Diagnostic Dashboard" — Modern Utility App Aesthetic

**Design Movement**: Neo-Brutalism meets Utility-First Design / Swiss Poster Grid

**Core Principles**:
1. Bold clarity — oversized typography and stark contrasts for at-a-glance scanning
2. Chunky interactivity — large touch targets and obvious affordances (garage-friendly)
3. Status-driven UI — every element communicates its state clearly
4. Zero ambiguity — the interface tells you exactly what to do next

**Color Philosophy**:
- Background: Off-white (#FAFAF8) with slight warmth
- Primary blocks: Jet black (#1A1A1A) for headers and key UI chrome
- Action: Electric lime (#BEFF3B) for primary CTAs — impossible to miss
- Category accents: Bold, saturated — red for automotive, green for garden, blue for electrical, orange for engine, purple for motorcycle
- Borders: Thick 2-3px black borders for neo-brutalist card definition

**Layout Paradigm**:
- Top navigation bar with oversized category pills
- Main area uses a "card stack" layout — each troubleshooting step is a full-width card
- Decision points use large binary buttons that take up the full card width
- Sidebar collapses to bottom sheet on mobile for tool-friendly one-hand use

**Signature Elements**:
1. Thick black borders on all interactive elements (neo-brutalist)
2. Oversized step numbers in a contrasting background block
3. "Status pills" showing diagnostic progress (Not Started → In Progress → Resolved)

**Interaction Philosophy**:
- Big, bold buttons designed for dirty/gloved hands
- Swipe-through steps on mobile like flipping through cards
- Clear binary choices: "Yes, this fixed it" / "No, try next step"
- Persistent floating "Start Over" button

**Animation**:
- Cards stack/unstack with a physical card-dealing motion
- Buttons have a satisfying press-down effect with slight scale
- Step transitions use a horizontal slide
- Status pills animate their color fill on state change

**Typography System**:
- Headlines: "Space Grotesk" Bold — geometric, modern, high-impact
- Body: "Inter" Regular at 18px minimum — optimized for readability at arm's length
- Step numbers: "Space Grotesk" Black at 48px+ — unmissable
- Labels: "Space Grotesk" Medium uppercase — utilitarian
